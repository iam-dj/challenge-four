Building a quiz with CSS, HTML, & JS

## Description

Building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions provides an interactive and engaging way to learn and practice coding concepts.

This project allowed me to test my coding knowledge and skills, and to practice solving coding problems. Additionally, it was fun. It did help me identify areas to improve such as local storage.

## Installation
